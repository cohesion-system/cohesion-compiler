# There are probably chains that don't need to be fully broken up.
# e.g.


#     if e1:
#         green1()
#     elif e2:
#         blue1()
#     elif e3:
#         blue2()
#     elif e4:
#         green2()
#     else:
#         blue3()
#     
# In this case we can transform to:

#     if e1:
#         green1()
#     elif e4:
#         green2()
#     else:
#         if e2:
#             blue1()
#         elif e3:
#             blue2()
#         else:
#             blue3()

# Then we have fewer state transitions and fewer lambda calls.  We can
# implement this optimization later, though.  For now, we simply lift
# every green if statement into the CAST.
